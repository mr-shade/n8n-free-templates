## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Process

### 1. Install n8n

If you haven't already installed n8n, follow these steps:

```bash
# Using npm (recommended)
npm install n8n -g

# Using Docker
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

### 2. Start n8n

```bash
# Start n8n locally
n8n

# Or if using Docker
docker run -it --rm \
  --name n8n \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

Access n8n at `http://localhost:5678`

## üöÄ Deploying Workflows

### 1. Select Your Workflow

Browse the category folders to find workflows relevant to your needs:
- AI_ML/
- E_Commerce_Retail/
- Finance_Accounting/
- Healthcare/
- HR/
- And 15+ more categories

Each JSON file represents a complete automation agent ready for deployment.

### 2. Import Workflow

1. In n8n, navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Import Workflows**
2. Click **Select File** and choose your desired workflow JSON
3. Click **Import**

### 3. Configure Credentials

Each workflow will require API credentials for the services it integrates with:

1. Open the imported workflow
2. For each node with a credential requirement:
   - Click on the node
   - In the credentials section, either:
     - Select an existing credential set
     - Or click **Create New** to add your API keys

Common credentials you may need:
- **OpenAI API Key** - For AI-powered workflows
- **Anthropic API Key** - For Claude-based agents
- **Cohere API Key** - For embedding workflows
- **Slack API Token** - For notification workflows
- **Google Sheets OAuth** - For data logging workflows
- **Database connections** - For data processing workflows

### 4. Test Workflow

1. Click the **Execute Workflow** button
2. Review the execution results
3. Make any necessary adjustments to node configurations

### 5. Activate Workflow

1. Click **Save** to save your workflow
2. Toggle the **Active** switch to enable automated execution
3. The workflow will now run according to its trigger (webhook, cron schedule, etc.)

## üîß Configuration Best Practices

### Credential Management

- Store API keys securely using n8n's built-in credential encryption
- Use environment variables for sensitive data in production
- Rotate API keys regularly according to your security policies

### Error Handling

- Most workflows include built-in error handling and alerting
- Customize alert destinations (Slack, Email, etc.) to match your notification preferences
- Monitor workflow execution logs in the n8n interface

### Performance Optimization

- Adjust execution concurrency based on your system resources
- Implement appropriate rate limiting for external API calls
- Use caching mechanisms where applicable to reduce API usage

## üìä Monitoring & Maintenance

### Built-in Monitoring

- Workflows include logging to Google Sheets or other destinations
- Error alerts are configured to notify you of issues
- Execution history is available in the n8n interface

### Regular Maintenance

- Update n8n to the latest stable version regularly
- Review and update API keys as needed
- Monitor workflow performance and adjust configurations as necessary

## üîí Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Restrict access to the n8n interface with authentication
- Regularly audit API key usage and permissions
- Implement network-level access controls for sensitive workflows

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Credential Errors**: Verify API keys and permissions
2. **Rate Limiting**: Check service provider rate limits and adjust workflow schedules
3. **Execution Failures**: Review node configurations and data formats

### Getting Help

For issues with specific workflows:
1. Check the workflow documentation in the category README
2. Review execution logs in n8n
3. Contact our support team with:
   - Workflow name and category
   - Error messages
   - n8n version
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
